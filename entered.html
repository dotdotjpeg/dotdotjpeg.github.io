      layout is (mostly) finished! took me more than a year, but i thought it was fun to work on and finish.
      that's what matters in the end, right? these free domain sites make it easy to mess around with different
      programming languages w/o relying on a self-hosted instance, too. i even downloaded an IDE for the occasion
      (way overkill for an exclusively html/css site... for now!!). webstorm is great! and i don't have to update
      a live website everytime i wanna see changes, which bodes well for my anxiety... win-win!! ok bye!
