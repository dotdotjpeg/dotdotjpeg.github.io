        Welcome to my webpage dedicated to fracking and fracking-related activity!
        Come for the oil, stay for the eventual demise of our planet caused by the ongoing climate crisis~

    <!-- that and add https://dotdotjpeg.github.io/ (update it too preferably w/ awesome custom domain on discord dot com) -->

        layout is (mostly) finished! took me more than a year, but i thought it was fun to work on and finish.
        that's what matters in the end, right? these free domain sites make it easy to mess around with
        different programming languages w/o relying on a self-hosted instance, too. i even downloaded an
        IDE for the occasion (way overkill for an exclusively html/css site... for now!!). webstorm is
        great! and i don't have to update a live website everytime i wanna see changes, which bodes
        well for my anxiety... win-win!! ok bye!
