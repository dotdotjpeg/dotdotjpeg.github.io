        omg there might be a new thingy thing on this site soon! as of late, there have not been new
        thingies (>implying that taking a month isn't an average amount of time for this website) bc
        i'm pursuing a new exciting venture... college!!!!! wow!!! in the meantime, check out the
        guestbook, which has been a strange product of wayward whiteboarding advertising (please send
        me message thru carrier pigeon if you have an answer as to why everyone's shitposting :sob:)

        it's (technically) complete! take a gander at the new pages added!! it's not much, but it's nice and
        simple, which is simple and nice (did this take like almost 3 weeks????). much of this effort is on the
        backend, i've taken my time to make this site mildly accessible. try the reading mode function on like,
        safari, and it should look relatively readable. i think. maybe. IM me if the pipes freeze over

        layout is (mostly) finished! took me more than a year, but i thought it was fun to work on and finish.
        that's what matters in the end, right? these free domain sites make it easy to mess around with different
        programming languages w/o relying on a self-hosted instance, too. i even downloaded an IDE for the occasion
        (way overkill for an exclusively html/css site... for now!!). webstorm is great! and i don't have to update
        a live website everytime i wanna see changes, which bodes well for my anxiety... win-win!! ok bye!
